# DCIT_205_IA

Welcome to my version of the website for the Computer Science Department. 
This is a redesign of the CS website.

Technologies used for Web development include HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is only the frontend of the website.

## Instructions on Cloning and Setup
1. Ensure that Git has been installed and setup on your computer. 
Once Git has been installed and setup on your computer, open your preferred code editor.<br>
2. Open the 'Terminal'. You should see an open command line interface, which may be Git Bash, Zsh, Powershell, or Command Prompt, among others.<br>
Click on the dropdown menu and ensure it is changed to Git Bash, if not open already.<br>
3. Open your forked repository in a web browser.<br> 
Click on the 'Code' at the top right.<br> You will have access to an HTTPS web url and an SSH key(once you have set that up)<br>
4. In the now open Bash, enter 'git clone (SSH key or the HTTPS web url)'. <br>The HTTPS web url can be used if the  SSH key is not available.<br> You should get a block of text ending with 'done'.<br>
5. Enter 'cd (Name of your forked repository)'. You should be in the repository now.<br>
6. To make sure you have everything and to reveal any hidden folders, enter ('ls -a' or 'ls -la').Either should work depending on the type of OS system on the computer.<br>
You should see a 'git' text in blue, meaning that it is actually a folder, storing all files that save your commits or your code changes.<br>
This concludes the setup.<br>
Any new files and changes can be committed and pushed later on.

## + What I learned from the project
I overcame challenges with flex after using them for the first time.<br>
I learned to use the 'span' tag, and got especially conversant with 'divs' and 'containers'.<br>
I learned about overflow and resizing of images and objects.

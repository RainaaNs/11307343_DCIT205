        <h2>Graduate Programmes (MPhil & MSc)</h2>
        <p>Embrace world-class graduate education with a unique blend of cutting-edge research and
            industry experience. The Department of Computer Science at the University of Ghana offers
            Masters of Science (MSc.) and Master of Philosophy (MPhil.) in Computer Science.<br>
            The MSc. is a 1-year (weekend/evening) program with a capstone project, while the MPhil 
            is a 2-year (full-time) program. The first year of the MPhil includes taught courses, and 
            the second year focuses on research and dissertation. These accelerated master's programs 
            are specially designed for both full-time and part-time study, equipping students with a
            broad knowledge of theoretical computer science and advanced technical skills.

        <hr class="separator3">

        <h2>Graduate Programmes (PhD)</h2>
        <p>Our Ph.D. programs lead the effort to extend the boundaries of knowledge through quality
        and industry-relevant research. This full-time research program has an expected duration of
            4 years, requiring a high level of commitment<br>
            Students are expected to reside close to the University and actively participate in the program.
            Under the guidance of the postgraduate committee, Ph.D. students create a personalized program of
            study, including a major area of specialization and at least two minor areas of specialization.<br>
            In addition to coursework, the department hosts regular seminars, providing a platform for students
            and faculty to review and critique research. Students are encouraged to join a research lab, 
            participating in activities related to Intelligent Space and Machine Learning, 
            Data Science/Big Data Analytics, Networking and Communications Engineering, and Cyber Security.
